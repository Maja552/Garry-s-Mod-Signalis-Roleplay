    [[LSTR
Elster units were chosen for the Penrose Program for their adaptability and reliability
under long-term isolation conditions.
Stoic and reserved, Elster units have a relatively stable neural pattern. It is best for
you to leave it alone and interact with the Elster unit as little as possible.
Elsters' neural pattern was a soldier of Vinetan origin, so their needs are basic. Avoid
talking to the Elster unit about the war.]],

    [[Penrose vessels are fitted with a specialized calibration pod which may help with Persona
stabilization.
To avoid resurfacing of Gestalt memories, do not show or give the Elster unit
photographs, especially of soldiers during the war. Do not show the Elster unit movies,
or let it listen to music. Do not try to befriend the Elster unit.]]
