    [[Each Cadre of Protektor Security Technicians is overseen by a Controller Unit, the most
common of which is the STCR "Stork" Type. One of the tallest Replika models thanks to
their extended legs, Storks figuratively and literally keep a constant birds-eye view of
any situation ready to direct and coordinate their assigned Security Technicians.
Their tough, no-nonsense demeanor, though sometimes described as brutal and even
cruel, makes them the perfect fit as unwavering sentinels of order.]],
