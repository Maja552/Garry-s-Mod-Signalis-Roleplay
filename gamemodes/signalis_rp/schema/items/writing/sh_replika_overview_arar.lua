    [[The tough 'worker bees' of the construction and repair industry.
One of the earlier Replika designs, the simple but efficient Aras are actually the most-
produced Replika type to date. These strong and heavy worker units are a perfect fit
for work in construction and production of industrial goods. In many places throughout
our Nation, Aras have already replaced all Gestalt workers in fields like Klimaforming and explosive ordnance disposal.]]
