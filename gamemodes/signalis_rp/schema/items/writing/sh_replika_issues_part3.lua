    [[MNHR
This neural pattern is extremely stable. Little has to be done to keep Mynahs happy.
They get along well with most other models thanks to their sometimes submissive,
sometimes motherly personality. Unlike other models, diary-keeping is not mandatory for
Persona stabilization. Small stuffed animals may be given as Fetish objects, though those
resembling cats should be avoided as they might cause resurfacing Gestalt memories.]],

    [[ADLR
Adler units work best when left alone. They do not mix well with their own type. They will
usually become very emotionally dependent on their Commander. Adlers are very
susceptible to bioresonant suggestion, making them fairly easy to control. However, they
become bored very easily and may need new Fetish objects at regular intervals for
stabilization.]]
