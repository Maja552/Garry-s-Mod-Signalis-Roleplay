    [[EULR
Eules tend to form large groups and like to sing and dance, as the original neural
pattern for this unit was a ballet dancer. Persona degradation can be easily prevented
in this unit by making sure they have access to music (through tape players or musical
instruments). Always place at least one mirror in Eule dorms, as they have a strong
urge to check their own appearance at regular intervals. Eules' Persona stabilizes by
keeping a tidy appearance and through regular social interactions. Eules will often
organize in groups of roughly ten units and give each other themed nicknames.]],

    [[ARAR
Even though they may seem like quiet simpletons, do not underestimate Aras. While they
may not show it, they judge those who are rude or unkind harshly and will quietly share
this judgment with their entire Cadre. Aras get along best with Eules, who tend to be
patient and friendly, and have a talent for reading Aras' expressionless faces.
In many facilities, Aras will construct service tunnels accessible only to them, often
under floors and in walls. Unstable units may retreat into these tunnel. It is not
recommended to attempt to retrieve them.]],

    [[Ara Personas can be best stabilized by allowing them access to plants to take care of,
ideally colorful flowers or trees.]]
