    [[KLBR
Great care should be given to Kolibris - their neural patterns are very unstable and
their Bioresonance Module makes them very susceptible to influence from others. Like
most bioresonant individuals, Kolibris will often subconsciously create an emotional
feedback loop, imitating and then broadcasting the emotions of those around them, acting
as a sort of amplifier.]],

    [[While they are trained to recognize and disengage this behavior, already unstable units
can sometimes spiral into Persona degradation.
Due to their bioresonant connection, neural pattern development in Kolibris varies less
than in other models. The constant exchange of memories and emotions between units of
a Cadre acts as a "safety net" that buffers extreme changes.]],

    [[However, once a majority of units in a Cadre degrade, they will drag remaining units down
with them. Because of this, it is important to decommission Kolibri units instantly when
they begin to degrade. For Person stabilization, Kolibris should have access to a
well-stocked library.]]
