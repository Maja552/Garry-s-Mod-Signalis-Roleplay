    [[STAR
Despite their normally laid-back demeanor, Stars have a strong internal hierarchy,
which is important to take into consideration when promoting units to officers. Not
promoting a respected unit or promoting a unit low in status can lead to friction within
dorms. Stars will occasionally develop in-group rules involving physical punishments. It is
recommended to allow some Officers to own military weapons as Fetish objects to stabilize
their Persona.]],

    [[STCR
Storch units initially have a short temper. Training them in patience early after
deployment is key, as their neural patterns are less stable then other models. Failing to do
so may yield an extremely volatile personality prone to cruelty and violence. A common
strategy is pairing them closely with an older STAR unit. Storch's Persona stabilizes by
showering or bathing. Books on history or mythology work well as Fetish objects.]]
