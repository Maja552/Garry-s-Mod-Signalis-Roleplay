    [[When it comes to dangerous cargo, heavy machinery and hazardous environments, no
other model rivals the MNHR units with their high-security power armor bodies. Even in
lethal radiation, under crushing pressure and in zero G, they keep their calm demeanor
and show exemplary teamwork. Despite their hulking bodies, underneath their face
shields a standard Generation 3 Cranial Construction can be found, making maintenance
and social interfacing as easy as with any other Replika Model.]],

[[Please note that the MNHR neural pattern is not suited for combat use. For combat
applications, the SAPR variant should be used, which employs a combat-capable Persona
in the same Frame. For more information, see [Schwere Anti-Panzer Replika 'Schnapper'].]]
