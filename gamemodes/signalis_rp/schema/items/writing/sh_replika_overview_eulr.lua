    [[EULR units are the backbone of the Eusan Nation's workforce.
These elegant multi-purpose worker units are suited for all kinds of domestic tasks like
cleaning, cooking, and simple medical and office work. Eules are highly social and get along
well with each other as well as most other Replika Models.
While unfit for combat, their lightweight frame makes them a prime choice for distant
facilities where supplies are limited. ]]
