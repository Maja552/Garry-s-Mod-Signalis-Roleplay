    [[The Standard model of the Protektor Security Technicians.
Fitted with extended legs, STAR units gracefully tower over most Gestalts. Despite their
heavy armor, they can move swiftly with their long stride.
Their cool and detached demeanor allows them to analyze situations with objectivity and
deploy force as required. Trained in close combat and riot control techniques, they
operate best in small squads led by an officer STAR unit equipped with a ballistic shield.]],
