    [[Despite that, it feels like we've made little effort to really understand or replicate
bioresonant effects with conventional technology, Our progress in the development of
electronics and microprocessors has stagnated for nearly a century now as we focus
solely on new ways to instrumentalize this barely understood phenomenon]],

    [[Take Replika production, for example: The process of duplicating a neural pattern from a
Gestalt host to a Replika brain is still not fully understood. How does Synchronicity
happen? Why is the duplicate imperfect? What happens to preexisting patterns in the
receiving brain?]],

    [[Recreating a Replika purely with microprocessors and digital programming may be far out
of reach, but I believe that we've become overly dependent on a poorly understood
technology controlled solely by a few gifted individuals. It may not be long before we're
back where we were under the Empire.]]
