        [[Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat, typically from the pork belly or from back cuts, which have less fat than the belly. It is eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e.g., the club sandwich). Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant. The word is derived from the Old High German bacho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the Old French bacon.
Bacon is best cooked at a temperature of 149 to 163 degrees.]],

        [[A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the skirt steak cut from the plate, the flank steak cut from the abdominal muscles, and the silverfinger steak cut from the loin and includes three rib bones. When the word "steak" is used without qualification, it generally refers to a beefsteak. In a larger sense, there are also fish steaks, ground meat steaks, pork steak and many more varieties.
Steak is best cooked at a temperature of around 190 degrees.]],

        [[Fish is a healthy, high-protein food, especially important for its omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats that our bodies don't produce on their own. Omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function, as well as normal growth and development. They have also become popular because they may reduce the risk of heart disease. Fish is also a good source of vitamin D, which most people are deficient in.
Fish is best cooked at a temperature of around 175 degrees.]],

        {"Tri-tip", Color(255, 255, 255), TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER},
        [[Tri-tip is a cut of beef from the bottom sirloin subprimal cut. It is a small triangular muscle, usually 1.5 to 2.5 pounds (675 to 1,150g) per side of beef. In the United States, this cut was typically used for ground beef or sliced into steaks until the late 1950s, when it became a local specialty in Santa Maria, California, rubbed with salt, pepper, and other seasonings, grilled, and served as barbecue beef.
Tri-tip is best cooked at a temperature of around 204 degrees.]],
